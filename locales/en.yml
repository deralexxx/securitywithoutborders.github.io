    fight racism, and fight for justice and democracy face increasing threats
    and persecution online.<br /><b>Security Without Borders is an open
    collective of hackers and cyber security professionals</b> who
    volunteer with assisting journalists, human rights defenders,
    and non-profit organizations with cyber security issues."

  activist_p1: "Security Without Borders is here to help. We can assist with web
    security assessments, conduct breach investigations and analysis, and
    generally act as an advisor in questions pertaining to cyber security. As
    security services are often expensive to come by, SWB offers these services
    free to organizations and people fighting against human rights abuse,
    racism, and other injustices."
